### What I Learned

During this project, I deepened my understanding of:

- JavaScript DOM manipulation for the mobile menu 📱

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
}
```

```js
const toggleMenu = () => {
  // Mobile menu toggle logic
}
```

- Enhancing accessibility features 🌐
- Optimizing performance for faster load times ⚡
- Exploring CSS animations for subtle UI enhancements ✨
